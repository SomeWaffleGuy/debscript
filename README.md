# DebScript
Messy Debian setup script, massively WIP

Should (mostly) work and provide a basic useable system

ONLY RUN ON XORG (GNOME restart is required to enable/disable settings properly, currently impossible on Wayland)

Wayland can be switched to post-install on supported hardware

### Instructions

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomeWaffleGuy/debscript/master/debscript.sh
chmod +x debscript.sh
./run.sh
```

# Additional Scripts
If you use Fedora (as I do at this point), check out the far higher quality;

https://github.com/SomeWaffleGuy/tippyscript

It includes a README.md with configuration tips helpful for Debian as well.
