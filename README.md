# DebScript
A horrible script I made for my personal use, now with options for Debian Testing or Debian Sid (since I 'downgraded' to Testing). Run as a non-root user for the sake of setting up sudo. I may or may not ever update this, use it however you want, up to and including mocking its lack of quality. Kinda untested in some ways, so you've been warned. I'd read over it if I were you.

### Instructions

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomeWaffleGuy/debscript/master/run.sh
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
