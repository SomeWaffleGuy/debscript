# DebScript
A horrible script I made for my personal use, customizes a GNOME-based Debian install from the netiso. I may or may not ever update this, use it however you want, up to and including mocking its lack of quality. Kinda untested in some ways, so you've been warned. I'd read over it if I were you.

### Instructions

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomeWaffleGuy/debscript/master/debscript.sh
chmod +x debscript.sh
./run.sh
```

# Additional Scripts
If you use Fedora (as I do at this point), check out the far higher quality;
